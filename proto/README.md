Generate python code from the `person.proto` file.

    protoc -I=. --python_out=./generated ./person.proto

The command generates a `person_pb2.py` file containing the Python classes for your Person message and its nested types.

While there's no built-in tool in the Protocol Buffers system for visualization, several third-party tools and methods can help generate diagrams or documentation from .proto files.

Protodot is a Go-based utility that can transform your .proto files into .dot format, which is used by Graphviz to generate graphical representations of graphs.

github.com/seamia/protodot

Invoke it by:

    ./protodot -src person.proto

Once the dot file is generated, you can generate the diagram using Graphviz.

    dot -Tpng output.dot -o person.png
