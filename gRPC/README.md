Ensure you have gRPC and the gRPC tools for Python installed:

    pip3 install grpcio grpcio-tools

We need to generate code for server and client side separately.

    python3 -m grpc_tools.protoc -I. --python_out=./server/generated --grpc_python_out=./server/generated helloworld.proto

    python3 -m grpc_tools.protoc -I. --python_out=./client/generated --grpc_python_out=./client/generated helloworld.proto

`--python_out` option is used to generate the Python classes for the protobuf messages defined in your .proto file. It produces a .py file that contains the data structures for all the messages and enums defined in your protobuf file, allowing you to serialize and deserialize those messages to and from Python objects. This file does not include the gRPC service client and server classes; it only deals with the message types.

`--grpc_python_out` option is used to generate the gRPC-specific Python classes, including both the client stubs and the server classes that you need to implement the service logic. These classes utilize the message classes generated by --python_out for sending and receiving messages over the network. This option is necessary to work with gRPC services, as it generates the code required to make RPC calls.

You can visualize proto files using protodot GO utility as discuss in proto sub-project.
